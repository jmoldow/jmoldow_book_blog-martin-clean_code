## Introduction

This repository will serve as blog of my reading of Martin's "Clean Code" book.

I plan to blog about each chapter as I read through it. I plan to include
summaries, key ideas, reactions, and my own takes on the proposed philosophies
and methodologies.

I care a lot about writing clean code. More relevantly, I care about learning
more about good software practices, so that I can refine my own internal
notions and philosophies of how to write good software. This book satisfies all
of those interests, and also comes recommended to me by coworkers and Reddit
users.

I want to get the most out of this book, which means that I shouldn't just read
it as quickly as possible. Rather, I want to reflect on each section, so that I
can retain the material, update my internal viewpoints, and make notes of
things to try out in my own coding. Also, after having pre-skimmed the first
few chapters, I know that there is material that I both agree and disagree
with, which I would like to discuss.

Thus, I am creating this blog, primarily for my own purposes of reflection, but
also so that I have a reference to refer back to, and also so that I may share
my thoughts with others.
